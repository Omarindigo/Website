<p>As a Visual Artist and Researcher, my work centers on bridging the gap between AI technologies and media through visual storytelling and aesthetic exploration. By utilizing a combination of animation, programming, and film, I create a praxis centered around emergent technologies.</p>

<p>My practice focuses on the creative direction of AI technologies, exploring their potential in artistic expression. Through a methodology that blends programming, video, and animation, I aim to lead audiences to a deeper understanding of our world and the possibilities inherent in these new technological dynamics.</p>

<p>My portfolio showcases projects that demonstrate this approach, highlighting how the integration of AI and traditional media can push the boundaries of visual art and storytelling.</p>            
		<blockquote>"The nature of life is of sublime dynamics and animating forces."</blockquote>
		<p>My skill set spans a wide range of digital and traditional media techniques. As an expert in digital and analog photography and video production, I capture and create compelling visual narratives. My proficiency extends to both front-end and back-end web development, enabling me to build interactive and dynamic online experiences. Competent in several programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, C++, and C#, I leverage these skills to create innovative digital solutions and explore the intersection of technology and art.</p>

<p>My technical expertise is complemented by proficiency in industry-standard software such as the Adobe Creative Suite, Blender for 3D modeling and animation, and various Stable Diffusion webUIs for AI-generated art. This diverse toolkit allows me to seamlessly blend different media and push the boundaries of visual storytelling. My background in biology and chemistry adds a unique perspective to my work, informing my artistic vision and enabling me to create surreal visual narratives animated by scientific theories. Whether developing AI-integrated applications, manipulating video at the pixel level, or crafting immersive multimedia experiences, I strive to create innovative and thought-provoking art that bridges the gap between technology and human experience.</p>

		<p class="project-description">Bio_Éxtasis is an experimental animation project that explores the animated sublime through the lens of both artificial and natural life dynamics. This visual poetry harnesses machine learning and AI to investigate the sublimity of motion, drawing inspiration from phenomena such as chaos theory, diffusion, and swarm behavior.</p>
        <p class="project-description">Comprising three interconnected vignettes, the project weaves distinct narratives into a cohesive expression of my praxis in animation, programming, and storytelling. Each segment captures and animates complex digital phenomena, embodying the ecstatic essence of life and transcending physical boundaries. Rooted in Kantian aesthetics, Bio_Éxtasis bridges art, science, and technology. The series serves as a visual codex, embodying my research and skills in emergent technologies and animation. It invites viewers to contemplate life's beauty, complexity, and sublimity, fostering a deeper appreciation for existence's intricacies.</p>
        <p class="project-description">Through this digital artistry, I aim to create a thought-provoking journey that blurs the lines between the natural and the digital, encouraging audiences to see the world through a new, awe-inspiring lens.</p>

        <p>"Disobedient Cyber Machine" is an innovative web-based interactive 3D experience that explores themes of autonomous artificial creations within a cyberpunk-inspired digital realm. Drawing inspiration from William Gibson's "Neuromancer," Scott Bukatman's "Disobedient Machines: Animation and Autonomy," and Jules Verne's "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea," this project creates a unique digital storytelling platform.</p> 
        <p>Leveraging advanced web technologies, particularly Three.js, the project constructs a complex 3D environment featuring interactive spheres with varied properties, including video textures for dynamic content playback and custom materials with normal and displacement maps for enhanced realism. The scene is further enriched by elements such as frames and pipes, rendered with image textures and normal maps, contributing to its depth and complexity. Advanced lighting techniques, including a configurable spotlight and ambient lighting, are implemented alongside a custom shader that generates a dynamic, animated background. User interaction, a central focus of the experience, is facilitated through precise object interaction, triggering animations, video transitions, and audio playback. A JSON-based system manages dialogue presented through draggable popup elements, enhancing the interactive narrative. Additional features include video playlist functionality, multiple audio elements, and responsive design. By seamlessly integrating Three.js, HTML5 multimedia, the Fetch API, custom WebGL shaders, and modern JavaScript.</p> 
        <p>"Disobedient Cyber Machine" demonstrates the capabilities of browser-based 3D graphics and interactive storytelling. This technically advanced and visually compelling web experience provides users with an immersive platform to explore concepts of autonomy, artificial life, and human-machine interaction within a rich, cyberpunk-inspired digital environment.</p>

		<p class="project-description">The KlimfAb Consultingtool was made in cooperation with 15 german sewage associations as a funded government project. </p>
		<p class="project-description">In a questionnaire with 26 different topics, maintainers of sewage associations are being assisted in preparing for the various difficulties that climate change is bringing for the environment, but also for companies that are maintaining the infrastructure of waterworks and sewages.</p>
		<p class="project-description">The tool offers possibility to save and evaluate the results and compare different variations of the answered qestions. Answers are automatically saved in a database. Also the tool offers a knowledge base that was created with the help of domain specialists, that already use this tool to evaluate their companies infrastructure and situation.</p>
